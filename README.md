## TextPeer

This is a very simple app which the only purpose is to use the [MultipeerConnectivity](https://developer.apple.com/reference/multipeerconnectivity) framework from Apple.  
This allows users to connect to other devices without internet access. It uses peer-to-peer Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  
Through an alert controller users can choose if he wants to host a session or to join an existing one. Once the connection is established they can start chatting.
